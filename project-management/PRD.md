# RCAP Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## Platform Name  

**RCAP – Risk Communication Activity Platform**

## Domain  

Best-fit: `rcap.com` (broad professional trust and global reach). Alternative: `rcap.info` (authoritative/resource tone), `rcap.net` (platform/network feel), `rcap.org` (nonprofit/NGO adoption).

## Executive Summary  

RCAP is a purpose-built platform for tracking, reporting, and analyzing public health risk communication activities. Offering role-based management, secure evidence uploads, and actionable dashboards, RCAP powers coordinated, verifiable communications for federal, state, and local health officials—optimized for low-bandwidth African and global contexts. Mapping and social media infodemiology modules are reserved for future expansion, enabling research-grade data synthesis without distracting from the MVP's central value proposition.

## MVP Scope

### 1. Organisation & User Management  

- Multi-tier roles: Super Admin (federal/org), Admin (state), Sub-admin (local), User (public/official).
- Hierarchical onboarding and permissions.
- Self-service profile creation and update.
- Default profile pictures: Abstract AI-generated avatars from [UI Faces](https://www.uifaces.co/category/abstract) will be used as default profile pictures for users who haven't uploaded a custom image.

### 2. Activity Tracking & Reporting  

- Creation, submission, and audit trail for risk communication activities.
- Evidence uploads: images, docs, audio, and video.
- Customizable reporting templates; metrics tagging.
- Submission dashboards and timeline view.

### 3. Dashboards & Analytics  

- Role-based dashboard: status tracking, activity heatmaps, engagement rates.
- Exportable summary reports for org leadership.

### 4. Communication  

- Internal chat/messaging between org levels.
- Notification system for urgent news or reminders.

### 5. Documentation & Workflow  

- Developer documentation (auto-generated/spec-driven).
- User help and onboarding guides per feature and role.
- All features artifact-documented via SpecKit.

## Future Expansion (Not in MVP)

### Phase 2 – Future Expansion:

- External/cross-sector mapping modules (disaster, emergency, workplace, etc.).
- Social media "silent monitoring": Twitter/X, Facebook, WhatsApp, based on public mentions, hashtags, or keywords.
- AI/ML pipeline for infodemiological analysis: sentiment, spike detection, misinformation tagging.
- Google Trends or search analytics module for real-time info demand visualization.
- Optional SMS gateway for low-connectivity field data.
- Researcher dashboard for social data and search tracking: time-series, thematic, and geographic overlays.
- Ushahidi, Sahana Eden, or open-source mapping integrations.

## Sample Use Case (For Future Mapping Module)

> "During the 2024–25 respiratory season, RCAP will enable researchers to automatically collect and analyze social media comments and search behaviors around HMPV or other pathogens, providing a real-time timeline, sentiment profile, and geographic heatmap of online discussion and information demand—without manual keyword tracking."

## Conclusion  

RCAP launches with a tight public health communication activity MVP and a well-articulated, modular roadmap for cross-sector expansion and powerful researcher tools. All feature creep is documented not delivered, and every AI assistant and developer works from strict, artifact-driven specs for full traceability and code quality.

# Crisis Communication Intelligence Platform

## Executive Summary

Version: 1.0 | Date: November 30, 2025 | Organization: [Your Organization Name]



## The Problem: When Meaning Collapses, People Die

Every year, thousands die not from lack of health information, but from communication that fails to make meaning across cultural and linguistic boundaries. During the 2023 Lassa Fever outbreak in Northern Nigeria, government messaging about "avoiding bush rats" backfired because it attacked a cultural food source. In UK South Asian communities during COVID-19, "protect yourself" messaging failed because it conflicted with communal obligation norms.



The root cause isn't translation—it's **semiotic breakdown**: the collapse of shared meaning-making systems between message senders (governments, health agencies) and receivers (diverse communities) during crisis conditions. These failures cost lives, erode trust, and waste resources.

**Evidence-based Innovation:** Our approach is validated through rigorous academic research methodology, building on established disaster semiotics theory while developing novel computational applications that demonstrate measurable impact in real-world crisis contexts.



## Our Solution: Computational Disaster Semiotics

We're building the world's first **Crisis Communication Intelligence Platform**—a system that combines AI-powered semiotic analysis with organizational coordination infrastructure to **predict and prevent meaning breakdown** before messages are deployed.



### How It Works:

1.  **Predictive Semiotic Assessment:** Organizations input messages and target populations. AI analyzes against a database of 2,000+ historical communication patterns, identifies specific cultural/linguistic risks (e.g., individualistic framing, technical terminology), and generates actionable recommendations to adapt the message for maximum compliance.

2.  **Organizational Coordination:** Multi-level hierarchy (Federal → State → Local) and role-based workflows ensure adapted messages are implemented consistently across all organizational levels.

3.  **Continuous Learning:** Field officers capture communication effectiveness data ("What worked and why?") which is anonymized, extracted as a new pattern, and fed back into the ML model. This **federated learning** model ensures every deployment improves the intelligence for all future users.



## Our Unique Position

We're the only platform that:

* **Predicts semiotic failure** before messages are deployed (not just post-mortems).

* **Combines coordination + intelligence** in one platform (not just workflow OR analytics).

* **Learns systematically** across crises and contexts, building an **irreplicable semiotic pattern database** (our moat).

* **Bridges research + practice** (Disaster Semiotics theory → operational B2G tool).

* **Validated through rigorous research:** Academic methodology ensures evidence-based development and peer-reviewed validation before commercialization.



| Competitor | What They Miss |

|:---|:---|

| DHIS2 (health data platform) | Tracks what happened, not why communication failed. |

| Everbridge (crisis alerts) | Delivers messages fast, doesn't analyze if they'll be understood. |

| Ushahidi (crisis mapping) | Reactive crowdsourcing, no prediction or coordination. |

| Translation Services | Cultural meaning adaptation, not just word translation. |



## Pilot Strategy: Programme Before Product

**Phase 1 (18-24 months): Research & Validation**



| Pilot | Focus | Strategic Value |

|:---|:---|:---|

| 🇳🇬 **Nigeria** (NCDC/State MOH) | Infectious disease outbreak response | Leverages founder's field experience; perfect for semiotic testing (multicultural). |

| 🇬🇧 **UK** (UKHSA/Local Authority) | Migrant/minority health communication | Validates relevance in Western healthcare systems; CIVALABS partnership. |

| 🇩🇪 **Germany** (RKI/Partner) | Multi-lingual health communication | EU market validation; academic collaboration. |



**Target Outcomes (Phase 1):**

* **30-50% improvement** in communication effectiveness.

* **2-3 peer-reviewed publications** validating the approach.

* **2,000+ semiotic patterns** in the database.



## Impact: Lives Saved Through Intelligent Communication

* **Short-term (18 months):** Hundreds of lives saved in pilot contexts; academic validation achieved.

* **Medium-term (3 years):** Thousands of lives saved across 10-15 deployed contexts; semiotic assessment becomes industry best practice.

* **Long-term (10 years):** Tens of thousands of lives saved; WHO/CDC adopt as standard practice; **Paradigm shift** from information transmission to meaning-making.



The platform addresses failures in public health, social cohesion (e.g., UK riots misinformation), climate adaptation, and emergency management. We start in health, building intelligence that is universal to all crisis types.



## Funding Request: Phase 1

* **Amount:** **£250,000 - £400,000** over 18-24 months

* **Use of Funds:** Platform development, pilot field operations, research partnerships, and operations.

* **Target Funders:** UKRI (Disaster Resilience), Wellcome Trust (Innovation), EU Horizon Europe, Gates Foundation.



## Why This, Why Now, Why Us

* **Why This:** The root problem of communication failure is universal and costly; no existing solution is predictive or semiotic.

* **Why Now:** Post-COVID urgency, UK focus on misinformation (2024 riots), AI/ML maturity, global health equity demands.

* **Why Us:** **Domain credibility** (NCDC field experience), **Theoretical foundation** (Disaster Semiotics), **Strategic positioning** (UK base, CIVALABS, academic pathway).



We respectfully request support to validate this platform and establish **Computational Disaster Semiotics** as the new standard for crisis-resilient societies.

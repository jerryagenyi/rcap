# Perplexity AI Research Prompt: Disaster Semiotics Validation

**Context for Perplexity:** You previously analyzed RCAP as a health communication coordination platform (Firebase prototype with organizational hierarchy, activity management, dashboards). The project has since evolved to integrate **computational disaster semiotics** as its core innovation. This prompt asks you to validate the new theoretical foundation and research approach.

## Research Request: Disaster Semiotics & Computational Semiotic Intelligence

### Background Context

RCAP (Risk Communication Activity Platform) is being repositioned as a **Crisis Communication Intelligence Platform** that applies computational disaster semiotics to predict and prevent communication failures during health crises. The core hypothesis is that communication failures are caused by **semiotic breakdown**—the collapse of shared meaning-making systems across cultural and linguistic contexts—rather than simple translation or logistics issues.

**Previous Analysis Context:**
- You analyzed RCAP as an organizational coordination platform
- Firebase prototype with Next.js + React
- Features: Activity management, hierarchical org structure, role-based dashboards
- Focus: Operational efficiency and coordination

**Current Evolution:**
- **Core Innovation:** Semiotic risk assessment that predicts where messages will fail before deployment
- **Theoretical Foundation:** Disaster semiotics + computational linguistics + ML
- **Approach:** Programme-first (research validation) → Product (commercialization)
- **Target:** Public health crisis communication (outbreaks, vaccination campaigns)

# RCAP Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Version: 2.0

Date: November 30, 2025

Status: Draft for Review

Platform Name: RCAP – Crisis Communication Intelligence Platform



## Executive Summary

**What is RCAP?**

RCAP (Risk Communication Activity Platform) is a **Crisis Communication Intelligence Platform** that combines organizational coordination infrastructure with **AI-powered semiotic analysis** to prevent communication failures during health crises.



**Core Innovation:** We don't just help organizations track activities—we **predict where health messages will fail** before they're deployed, enabling culturally-intelligent communication that saves lives.



**Strategic Positioning:** Programme-First (Grant-funded pilots) → Validated product → B2G SaaS commercialization.



## 1. Product Vision & Strategy

### 1.1 Long-Term Vision (5-10 years)

A world where crisis communication is semiotically intelligent by default.

### 1.2 Mission Statement

To prevent preventable deaths from communication failures by building the world's first computational disaster semiotics platform that predicts meaning breakdown before messages are deployed.

### 1.3 Success Metrics

* **Phase 1 (MVP - 18-24 months):** 30-50% improvement in communication effectiveness, 3 pilot deployments, 75%+ AI prediction accuracy, 2,000+ semiotic patterns in database.

* **Phase 2 (Scale - 3-5 years):** Thousands of lives saved (modeled), 10-15 organizations using platform, Industry standard emerging.

### 1.4 Competitive Positioning

Our **Moat:** Irreplicable semiotic pattern database that grows with every deployment through federated learning architecture. We are the only platform that is predictive and semiotic.



## 2. User Personas & Roles

### 2.1 Primary Personas

1.  **State Health Coordinator (Admin):** Focus on planning, approval, and coordination. **RCAP Help:** Semiotic risk assessment before launching campaigns, coordination across local departments.

2.  **Field Health Officer (User):** Focus on execution, local adaptation, and structured reporting. **RCAP Help:** Culturally-adapted message recommendations, offline-capable reporting, contributions feed system learning.

3.  **Federal Public Health Official (Super Admin):** Focus on national oversight, policy, and equitable outcomes. **RCAP Help:** National dashboard, cross-regional learning, evidence base for policy decisions.

4.  **Research Epidemiologist (Analyst):** Focus on academic study and policy advice. **RCAP Help:** Access to anonymized effectiveness data and semiotic pattern database.

### 2.2 Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Access Level | Key Functions |

|:---|:---|:---|

| **Super Admin** | Full system access | Manage organizations, national analytics, policy settings. |

| **State Admin** | Organization + children | Plan/approve activities, state analytics. |

| **LGA Officer** | Local activities only | Create/submit activities, field reporting, local team management. |

| **Data Analyst** | Read-only + export | View analytics, generate reports, export data. |

| **Field Officer** | Assigned activities | Execute activities, submit reports, upload evidence. |



## 3. MVP Feature Set (Phase 1: 18-24 months)

### 3.1 Core Features (Must-Have)

* **Feature 1: Multi-Tier Organization Management**

    * *Requirement:* Hierarchical organization tree (Federal → State → LGA/Local), role-based permissions, organization profiles.

    * *Technical Notes:* PostgreSQL adjacency list for hierarchy, Row-Level Security (RLS).

* **Feature 2: Activity Planning & Management**

    * *Requirement:* Activity creation workflow (Title, Type, Target Population, Planned Message), Draft/submit/approve workflow, Version history.

* **Feature 3: Semiotic Risk Assessment (Core Innovation)**

    * *Requirement:* **Phase 1 (MVP - Rule-Based):** Manual pattern matching, risk scoring, display predicted failure points, recommend adaptations.

    * *Acceptance Criteria:* Input message content + target context; receive risk assessment within 5 seconds; see 3-5 specific predicted failure points; get 3-5 actionable recommendations; view similar successful campaigns; user can apply recommendations (one-click).

    * *Phase 2 (Post-MVP):* ML-Powered prediction, confidence intervals, automated pattern extraction.

* **Feature 4: Field Reporting & Evidence Collection**

    * *Requirement:* Offline-capable report submission (PWA), capture communication effectiveness metrics (Understanding Score, Compliance, Barriers Encountered), evidence uploads (photos, documents), GPS location tagging.

    * *Critical:* Data captured here is the training data for the semiotic patterns.

* **Feature 5: Role-Based Dashboards**

    * *Requirement:* Role-specific overview (National metrics for Super Admin, activities pending approval for State Admin, assigned tasks for Field Officer).

* **Feature 6: Internal Communication System**

    * *Requirement:* One-on-one and group messaging (organization-based), real-time notifications.

* **Feature 7: Pattern Database (Foundation for Intelligence)**

    * *Requirement:* Storage schema for `SemioticPattern` (ID, Type, Context, Failed Element, Successful Alternative, Evidence), search/query capabilities, pattern validation workflow.

## 4. User Flows (Key Workflows)

* **Activity Planning Workflow:** State Admin inputs message → Clicks "Assess Semiotic Risk" → Applies recommendations → Submits/Activates → Field Officers see assigned task.

* **Field Reporting Workflow:** Field Officer executes activity → Submits report with effectiveness data (online/offline) → System extracts patterns (background job) → State Admin reviews report.

* **Cross-Organizational Learning Workflow:** Org A runs campaign, pattern is extracted and stored (anonymized) in Pattern DB → Org B runs similar campaign, receives prediction based on Org A's learning.

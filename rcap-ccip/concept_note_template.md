* **Problem:** Communication failures during crises (semiotic breakdown) cost lives, erode trust, and waste resources.

* **Solution:** AI-powered Semiotic Intelligence Platform to predict and prevent meaning collapse before messages are deployed.

* **Innovation:** Computational Disaster Semiotics—the world's first predictive system of its kind.

* **Ask:** £[250,000 - £400,000] over 18-24 months for Phase 1 Pilots.

* **Impact:** Thousands of lives saved; establish new industry standard; advance global health equity.

* **Team:** NCDC field experience (Founder) + CIVALABS support + Academic backing.



## 2. Context, Problem, & Rationale (1-1.5 pages)

### 2.1 The Crisis Communication Paradox

During health crises (COVID-19, cholera, Lassa Fever), messages are often received but misunderstood, leading to non-compliance. The problem is not lack of transmission, but **failure of meaning-making**.

### 2.2 Semiotic Breakdown: The Root Cause

* **Definition:** The collapse of shared sign/meaning systems across cultural and linguistic boundaries under stress.

* **Case Example:** Lassa Fever, Nigeria (2023): Messaging about "avoiding bush rats" failed because it attacked a cultural food source without offering alternatives, leading to delayed behavior change.

* **Global Relevance:** This failure pattern is universal—from vaccine hesitancy in London to evacuation failures in Caribbean—driven by conflicts between official signs and local cultural frameworks.

* **The Misinformation Link:** Misinformation thrives in the vacuum created by official communication that is ambiguous or culturally misaligned. A clear, resonant message is the strongest counter to rumor.

### 2.3 Why Existing Solutions Are Insufficient

Current solutions (translation, alert systems, data platforms like DHIS2) address speed and logistics, but **fail to address meaning**. They track *what* happened, not *why* communication succeeded or failed.

Post-COVID systematic reviews confirm the gap—governments experienced "difficulties in effective communication" driven by cultural and contextual misalignment rather than technical delivery failures (Okuhara et al., 2025, JMIR Infodemiology). This validates the need for semiotic intelligence that addresses meaning-making, not just message delivery.

### 2.4 Cost & Consequences

* **Lives lost:** Preventable deaths from non-compliance with health guidance.

* **Resources wasted:** Failed campaigns cost millions in redesign and redeployment.

* **Trust eroded:** Failed communication reinforces government distrust, creates information vacuums for misinformation, undermines future crisis response capacity.

* **Equity gaps widened:** Marginalized communities face greatest semiotic barriers, standard messaging serves dominant culture only, vulnerable populations bear disproportionate harm.



## 3. Proposed Solution (1.5-2 pages)

### 3.1 Overview: Computational Disaster Semiotics Platform

We are building a **Crisis Communication Intelligence Platform** (CCIP) that integrates predictive AI into public health workflow.

* **Core Innovation:** A **federated learning architecture** that enables cross-organizational intelligence from a **semiotic pattern database** (our moat) while respecting client data sovereignty.

### 3.2 How It Works

* **Phase 1: Message Planning (Prediction)**
    * Health agency plans campaign → Inputs message + target context (culture, language, trust level).
    * AI analyzes against pattern database → Identifies **semiotic risks** (e.g., individualistic framing conflict, authority mismatch).
    * Generates **actionable recommendations** (e.g., "Reframe as family protection," "Use community leader messenger").
    * **Regulatory Compliance:** Designed for EU AI Act "limited risk" classification with built-in transparency and human oversight mechanisms.

* **Phase 2: Field Execution (Coordination & Data Capture)**
    * Field officers use platform (mobile/PWA) to: execute activities, capture evidence, and report structured data on **communication effectiveness** (e.g., "Message understanding score: 4/10," "Barriers encountered: religious objections").

* **Phase 3: Learning & Improvement (Network Effects)**
    * Field data → **Anonymization pipeline** → Extracted as new patterns → ML model retraining.
    * **Network effects:** Pattern learned in Nigeria (e.g., why 'bush rat' avoidance failed) is immediately used to inform and improve a prediction for a similar campaign in Germany (e.g., why 'meat handling' advice is being ignored).

### 3.3 Technical Architecture (Summary)

* **Stack:** Vue 3 + Quasar (Frontend), Laravel 11 + PostgreSQL (Backend), Python + FastAPI (ML/AI Layer).

* **Data Architecture:** Tiered system supporting client-managed data (Option A) while extracting anonymized, generalizable patterns (Tier 2, our IP) for ML model.

***[Customize this section heavily per funder - example for UKRI Disaster Resilience]***

**UKRI Disaster Resilience:** This project directly addresses the UKRI's priority on **"improving society's ability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters"** by focusing on communication as critical infrastructure. It is a UK-based, research-backed innovation with a clear pathway to a global, scalable B2G SaaS commercialization model, aligning with the UK's Innovator economy goals.

**NIHR AI Award:** Aligns with NIHR AI Award priorities for robust testing of AI in health and care contexts with clear validation methodology. The programme-first approach ensures rigorous evidence generation before deployment, addressing NIHR's emphasis on safety and effectiveness validation.

**Wellcome Trust:** Addresses Wellcome's focus on generating "context-specific evidence using community knowledge" with "actionable policy outcomes," particularly relevant to climate-health intersections and mental health communication during crises.
